Our founder sam walton always said our people make the difference, and many decades later, that remains true. Were focused on investing in our associates to ensure were offering good jobs with meaningful benefits and room for career growth so there is a path of opportunity for everyone at walmart. We are continuously investing in higher wages and the average hourly wage for our u. S. Frontline associates is more than $17.50. Over the past few years, weve introduced higher-paying roles in our stores, raised wages for more than 1 million frontline associates and invested in clearer career pathways that give associates more room to increase their pay as they build a career here. While pay is important to our associates, they have told us its just one part of the equation. Walmart associates can also create schedules that work for them. Some associates are looking for consistency they can rely on with their schedule and paycheck, while others value ultimate flexibility and want to pick up or even trade for shifts. Either way, weve got them covered. Being a walmart associate also means getting access to a lot of great benefits, perks and discounts that help improve your life in meaningful ways. We offer benefits like medical coverage, paid time-off, 401(k) match, paid leave of up to 16 weeks for our eligible birth mothers and an adoption benefit that may pay eligible associates up to $20,000 to cover costs. We also help associates save money and live better by offering a 10% discount on fresh produce and select general merchandise. Theyve told us they love saving money on gas and free delivery through free walmart+ memberships, and we also offer discounts for things like cell phone plans and gym memberships. As the worlds largest retailer, we understand the importance of workforce development and offer skills and leadership training through our walmart academies. 75% of our salaried store, club and supply chain management began their careers as hourly associates, and the average entry-level associate promotes to a role of higher pay and greater responsibility within about seven months. We have a culture of promoting from within, and were committed to offering each associate the support and resources to build a better career and life. For example, walmart offers access to a free college degree by paying for 100% of the cost of associates tuition and books through our live better u program. Simply put: we want to see our associates thrive.
